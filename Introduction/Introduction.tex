The Standard Model has proven to be one of the greatest accomplishments of modern day particle physics.  It has have been used to make countless predictions of various physics processes across a wide range of energies that have proven to be consistent with experimental measurements.  The final piece of the Standard Model to be discovered was the Higgs boson, which was found by the ATLAS \cite{Aad:2012tfa} and CMS \cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj} experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012.  

Despite the remarkable descriptive power of the Standard Model, there are a number of features in the universe that it does not provide a description for.  How does gravity fit into the Standard Model?  Why is there an excess of matter over antimatter in the observable universe?  How does the "dark matter" predicted by astronomers couple with the particles in the Standard Model?  What are the properties of the Higgs field in the Standard Model?  While the LHC and previous generations of particle collider experiment have had enormous success in validating the Standard Model and searching for new physics, it is clear that there is more work to be done. 

The linear collider experiments are proposals for the next generation of particle collider experiment.  These experiments are $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ colliders with a focus on precision measurements.  The physics program for the linear collider is designed to complement and extend the work done at the LHC and to develop our understanding of particle physics.  One of the primary goals of the linear collider experiments is to study the Higgs field of the Standard Model.  A detailed description of the Higgs field is likely to help in the description of "dark matter" as many extensions of the Standard Model Higgs field contain particles that fit the properties of "dark matter".  The linear collider experiments will also provide a detailed description of the properties of the top quark.  This will complement the Higgs study as the strongest couplings for the Higgs in the Standard Model occurs with the top quark.  Another goal of the linear collider experiments is to provide high precision measurements of the electroweak sector in the Standard Model.  As the electroweak sector is the only place in the Standard Model where CP violation can occur, a detailed description will help to determine why there is an excess of matter over antimatter in the universe.  Furthermore, the linear collider will expand the descriptive reach for many Standard Model extensions such as supersymmetry (SUSY).

The linear collider experiments place emphasis on precision measurements.  As well as searching for beyond Standard Model physics, precision measurements will guide the future direction of experimental particle physics.  Precision measurements have helped to guide the course of particle physics experiments in the past; LEP electroweak data, which gave indirect information about the lightness of the Higgs boson, was used to build the physics case for the LHC.  By colliding $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$, the experimental conditions found at the linear collider will be far cleaner than those at the LHC, which makes it easier to perform precision measurements.  High precision measurements are made possible at the linear collider due to the use of particle flow calorimetry, which is a revolutionary technique in detector design that offers exceptional energy resolution for jets.  This paradigm shift means the linear collider detectors are significantly different from those found in previous generations of particle colliders.  As the detector design is continually evolving, the ongoing research in this area is vital for determining the overall success of these experiments.  

This thesis is organised as follows.  Chapter \ref{chap:anomalousgaugecouplingtheory} contains a summary of the Standard Model as well as an outline of the physics of interest related to the analysis presented in chapter \ref{chap:PhysicsAnalysis}.  Chapter \ref{chap:clicvertex} presents a study into a novel technology option for the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC) vertex detector.  Chapter \ref{chap:energyestimators} contains numerous studies related to the treatment of energy deposits in the linear collider simulation.  This begins with an outline of the calibration procedure for the linear collider detector simulation.  This is followed by a number of novel software techniques aimed at improving the energy resolution of a calorimeter designed for particle flow calorimetry.  Finally, the chapter concludes with a study of the timing requirements applied in the software trigger that will be used at the linear collider experiment.  Chapter \ref{chap:detopt} presents an optimisation study of the linear collider calorimeters.  The starkest contract in detector design when comparing particle flow calorimeter and tradition calorimeter is the design of the calorimeters.  As the linear collider experiments will be the first experiments purposefully built with particle flow calorimetry in mind, there is no precedence for the detector design.  Therefore, these studies are vital for guiding detector design.  Chapter \ref{chap:PhysicsAnalysis} contains a study into anomalous gauge couplings that are sensitive to massive gauge boson quartic vertices at the CLIC experiment.  This study is of particular interest as it provides a detailed probe of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of the Standard Model as well as showing CLICs sensitivity to a possible extension to the Standard Model.  The thesis concludes with a summary in chapter \ref{chap:summary}.

\section{Future Linear Colliders}
There are two proposed future linear collider experiments; the International Linear Collider (ILC) and the Compact LInear Collider (CLIC).  These colliders are both $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ colliders with focus upon precision measurements, however, they operate at different collision energies, which presents each experiment with its own unique challenges.  One benefit of a linear collider is that it is possible to stage the experiment at several different energies throughout the experiments lifetime

%========================================================================================

\subsection{The International Linear Collider}
The ILC, shown in figure \ref{fig:ilc}, initially plans to operate at a centre-of-mass energy of 250~GeV to study the Higgs boson in detail through the Higgstrahlung process ($\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-} \rightarrow ZH$).  This analysis of this process makes it possible to examine all the decays of the Higgs boson with high precision.  The next phase of operation will increase the collision energy to 500~GeV.  This will extend the study of the Higgs, making it possible to observe the Higgs coupling with the top quark and to determine self interactions of the Higgs.  Furthermore, at this energy, it will be possible to search for evidence for SUSY and extended Higgs states.  Finally, there is an option to increase the centre-of-mass up to 1~TeV, which would extend the search for SUSY and composite Higgs models.

%========================================================================================

\subsection{The Compact Linear Collider}
The CLIC experiment, shown in figure \ref{fig:clic}, plans to operate with maximum collision energy of 3~TeV.  CLIC will also operate at intermediate energy stages, however, these energies are to be determined by the ongoing work at the LHC.  The large collision energy of CLIC gives it a greater physics reach for searching for extensions to the Standard Model, e.g. SUSY, that would be inaccessible at ILC-like energies \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.  Although the exact energies for the staging of the CLIC experiment are not certain, CLIC will operate at a low collision energy during staging, $\sim 500$~GeV, to study the Higgs.  The higher energy stages of the CLIC experiment will provide access to different channels for studying Higgs couplings, as shown by figure \ref{fig:higssprodclic}.

\subsubsection{Experimental Conditions at CLIC}
The CLIC experiment will operate in a unique environment in comparison to either the ILC or previous generations of lepton colliders.  It is vital that this is properly accounted for when determining the physics potential that CLIC has to offer.  The following aspects of the CLIC experiment present the largest challenges to the physics potential:

\begin{itemize}
\item The high bunch charge density.  The small beam size at the impact point produces very large electromagnetic fields.  These fields can interact with the opposite beam particles causing them to radiate photons in an effect known as beamstrahlung.  Beamstrahlung acts to reduce the collision energy of the $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ pairs.   
\item Beam related backgrounds.  Beamstrahlung photons can subsequently interact to produce background events that must be accounted for.  Dominant backgrounds of this form that cannot be easily vetoed in the reconstruction include incoherent pair production of $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ and $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \text{Hadron}$.  While these backgrounds are also problematic for the ILC experiment, the lower collision energy means it is has a much smaller impact on performance.
\item Fast readout technology.  The CLIC bunch train consists of 312 bunches with a repetition rate of 50~Hz.  Each bunch is separated by 0.5~ns, therefore, it will be necessary to integrate over multiple bunch crossing when reading out the detectors.  This places tight constraints on all detector electrical readout speeds and time resolutions.   
\end{itemize}

%========================================================================================

\subsubsection{Beam-Related Backgrounds at CLIC}
\label{sec:beamrelatedbackgrounds}
The primary sources of background for the CLIC experiment are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ pair creation from the interaction of a beamstrahlung photons with the opposing beam.  The different mechanisms for pair creation are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Coherent pair production}.  This mechanism involves the interaction of a real beamstrahlung photon with the electromagnetic field from the opposing beam.
\item \textbf{Trident pair production}.  This mechanism involves the interaction of a virtual beamstrahlung photon with the electromagnetic field from the opposing beam.
\item \textbf{Incoherent pair production}.  This mechanism involves the interaction of a real or virtual beamstrahlung photon with the individual particles in the opposing beam.
\end{itemize}
\item $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \text{Hadron}$ events from the interaction of real or virtual beamstrahlung photons with each other.  
\item Beam halo muons that arise from interactions of the beam particles during collimation.  The dominant mechanisms producing beam halo muons are photon conversions into muon pairs ($\gamma \text{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}\text{e}^{-}$) and annihilation of positrons with atomic $\text{e}^{-}$ into muon pairs ($\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$) \cite{Pilicer:2015ijy}.
\end{itemize}
Each of these has to be properly addressed to get a true measure of the physics potential at CLIC.  Coherent and trident pair production is not a dominant source of background as they are produced at low transverse momenta, as figure \ref{fig:backgroundangle} shows, and a simple cut would veto these backgrounds.  This is not the case for incoherent pair production of $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$, which are dominant in the forward regions of the detector, and $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \text{Hadron}$, which are dominant in the tracker and the calorimeters (with the exception of low radii in the calorimeter endcaps) \cite{Linssen:2012hp, Sailer:2012mfa}.  Beam halo muons are not a major source of background either as they can be easily removed during the reconstruction as they produce a clear signal in the detector.  An algorithm was developed within the PandoraPFA framework for this purpose and it was found to be highly effective at removing the beam halo muons background \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Introduction/Plots/CDRPlots/BackgroundAngleCut.pdf}

Figure taken from \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.}
\label{fig:backgroundangle}
\end{figure}

$\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \text{Hadron}$ events are the most dominant source of background to consider at CLIC as these events deposit more energy throughout the detector than incoherent pair production of $\text{e}^{+}\text{e}^{-}$ events \cite{Linssen:2012hp}.  Although incoherent pairs are still a source of background, they will produce a second order effect in comparison to the $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \text{Hadron}$ events.
