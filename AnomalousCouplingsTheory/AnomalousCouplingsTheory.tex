\section{The Standard Model}
The Standard Model is a non-abelian gauge theory of the $\text{SU}(3) \times \text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ symmetry group.  It provides a description of three of the four fundamental forces of nature: the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear forces \cite{Griffiths:1987tj,Peskin:1995ev}.  The Standard Model contains a total of 24 fermion fields: six flavours of quark each with three colours and six leptons.  A summary of the properties of these particles is given in table \ref{table:smleptons} and \ref{table:smquarks}.  As these fields, $\psi$, are spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, they obey the Dirac equation
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \overline{\psi}(i \slashed{\partial} - m)\psi \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian density and $m$ is a mass term.  The derivative term, $\slashed{\partial} = \gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}$, represents a summation over the partial \textcolor{blue}{derivative}, $\partial^{\mu} = (\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}},\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}},\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}},\frac{\partial}{\partial{z}})$, of the field $\psi$ and the gamma matrices, $\gamma^{\mu}$.  Each of the gauge transformations of the Standard Model are defined by a unitary operator \textrm{U}, which acts to transform the vector space, $\Psi$, formed from a combination of fermion fields, $\psi$, in the following way
%
\begin{equation}
\Psi \rightarrow \Psi' = \textrm{U}\Psi \text{ .}

\label{table:smquarks}
\end{table}

In the Standard Model, the Lagrangian density describing the fermion fields is invariant under a $\text{SU}(3)$, $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ and U(1) gauge transformations.  The $\text{SU}(2)_{L}$ gauge symmetry acts on doublets formed of pairs of left handed chiral components of the fermion fields, $\psi_{L} = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma_{5})\psi$, while the right handed components, $\psi_{R} = \frac{1}{2}(1+\gamma_{5})\psi$, transform trivially as singlets \cite{Weinberg:1967tq}.  Similarly, the SU(3) symmetry acts on triplets formed of the fermion fields for each flavour of quark.  All fields transform under the fundamental representation of U(1).  The invariance of the Standard Model Lagrangian to these gauge transformations is established by introducing 12 gauge fields, summarised in table \ref{table:smbosons}, through the covariant \textcolor{blue}{derivative} of the fermion fields
%
\begin{equation}
\partial^{\mu} \rightarrow D^{\mu} = \partial^{\mu} + ig_{1}YB^{\mu} + ig_{2} \textbf{T} \cdot \textbf{W}^{\mu} + ig_{3}\textbf{X} \cdot \textbf{G}^{\mu} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $B^{\mu}$ is the gauge field for the U(1) symmetry, $\textbf{W}^{\mu}$ ($\text{W}^{\mu}_{j}, j =1,2,3$) are the fields of the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ symmetry and $\textbf{G}^{\mu}$ ($\text{G}^{\mu}_{j}, j =1,..,8$) are the fields of the SU(3).  $Y$ is the weak hypercharge, which relates to the chirality and flavour of the fermion field that it is associated to.  The three coefficients $g_{1}$, $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ are coupling constants related to the three gauged symmetry groups in the Standard Model.

\end{equation}
%
\noindent gives the electroweak gauge bosons; $\text{W}^{\pm}$, Z and $\gamma$.  This mixing ensures that the $\text{W}^{\pm}$ and Z bosons become massive, while the $\gamma$ remains massless.  The $\text{G}^{\mu}_{j}$ fields are the eight massless gluons of the strong force.   $\textbf{T}$ and $\textbf{X}$ are the generators for the SU(2) and SU(3) symmetries, which are typically chosen as
%
\begin{equation}
T_{i} = \frac{1}{2}\tau_{i} \text{ ,} \\
X_{i} = \frac{1}{2}\lambda_{i} \text{ ,} \\

%
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
%
\noindent \textcolor{blue}{and} $f_{ijk}$ are the fully anti-symmetric structure constants of the group, $K^{\mu}_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ gauge field of the group and $m_{K}$ is a mass term for the gauge boson.  The structure constants are defined from the commutation relations between generators of the symmetry group
%
\begin{equation}
[T_{i},T_{j}] = if_{ijk}T_{k} \text{.} 
\end{equation}
%
\noindent These structure constants govern the self-interactions for the gauge bosons.  There is only one structure constant for the U(1) symmetry, which is zero, as the U(1) symmetry is abelian.  The SU(2) symmetry structure constants are $f_{ijk} = \epsilon_{ijk}$, where $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita tensor.  Due to the symmetries that are present in the Standard Model, $m_{K} = 0$ for all the gauge fields, however, it is clear that this is not the case.

\section{Higgs Physics}
\label{sec:higgsphysics}
Mass terms are generated in the Standard Model by introducing a Higgs field that undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking.  This allows the gauge bosons, as well as the quarks and leptons, to obtain a mass, while still respecting the gauge symmetries found in the Standard Model.  

%========================================================================================

\subsection{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}
\label{sec:ssb}
To illustrate spontaneous symmetry breaking, consider a complex scalar field \psi with the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \partial^{\mu} \psi^{*} \partial_{\mu} \psi -m^{2} |\psi|^{2} = \partial^{\mu} \psi^{*} \partial_{\mu} \psi - V(\psi) \text{ ,}
\label{equ:kleingordon}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $m$ is a mass term and $V(\psi)$ is the potential \textcolor{blue}{of} the field $\psi$.  This Lagrangian density is invariant under the global symmetry $\psi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha} \psi$.  By adding extra terms to the Lagrangian, which retain the invariance to this global symmetry, it is possible to modify the interactions of this scalar field.  Consider modifying the potential of the scalar field to the following
%
\begin{equation}
\text{V}(\psi) = m^{2}|\psi|^{2} + \lambda |\psi|^{4} \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent If $m^{2} > 0$, the potential has a \textcolor{blue}{minimum} at zero, however, if $m^{2} < 0$ then the minima exists on a circle in the complex $\psi$ plane, which is centred at $(0,0)$ and has radius $v = \sqrt{-m^{2}/\lambda}$.  To quantise this theory it is necessary to expand about the \textcolor{blue}{minimum} of the potential.  However, in the case of $m^{2} < 0$ there are an infinite number of choices of minima to expand about.  Irrespective of the choice of \textcolor{blue}{minimum} used to expand the field about, the symmetry $\psi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha} \psi$ is broken.  Fluctuations about the \textcolor{blue}{minimum} along the degenerate direction leave the potential unchanged, which is a consequence of the breaking of the $\psi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha} \psi$ symmetry; this is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking.  Goldstone's theorem \cite{Goldstone:1962es} implies that, for Lorentz-invariant theories, spontaneous symmetry breaking always leads to the existence of massless particles known as Goldstone bosons.  If the complex scalar field $\psi$ is expanded about the non-zero minima, $\psi$ takes the form
%
\begin{equation}
\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(v + \psi_{1} + i \psi_{2}) \text{ ,}
\label{equ:minima}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{2}$ are real fields and $v = \sqrt{-m^{2}/\lambda}$.  Applying this parameterisation to the Lagrangian yields a mass term of $\sqrt{-m^{2}}$ for the $\psi_{1}$ field.  However, there is no corresponding mass term for the $\psi_{2}$ field, which indicates that it is massless as predicated by Goldstone's theorem
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}\partial^{\mu} \psi_{1} \partial_{\mu} \psi_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\partial^{\mu} \psi_{2} \partial_{\mu} \psi_{2} - m^{2}|\psi_{1}|^{2} + ... \text{ \textcolor{blue}{.}}
\end{equation}

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the origin of gauge boson mass terms when applied to local symmetries instead of global ones.  For example, consider the global symmetry, $\psi \rightarrow e^{i\alpha} \psi$ that exists in equation \ref{equ:kleingordon}.  If this global symmetry is promoted to a local symmetry by letting $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha(x)$ and $\partial^{\mu} \rightarrow D^{\mu} = \partial^{\mu} + iA^{\mu}$, where $A^{\mu}$ \textcolor{blue}{is} the gauge field that transforms as $A^{\mu} \rightarrow A^{\mu} - \partial^{\mu}\alpha(x)$, the Lagrangian becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = (D^{\mu} \psi)^{*} (D_{\mu} \psi) - m^{2} |\psi|^{2} - \lambda |\psi|^{4} \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent If the $\psi$ field is expanded about a non-zero \textcolor{blue}{minimum} in the potential, i.e. $m^{2} < 0$ and $v = \sqrt{-m^{2}/\lambda}$, as was done in equation \ref{equ:minima}, then a gauge boson mass term, $+\frac{v^{2}}{2} A^{\mu} A_{\mu}$, is generated from the $(D^{\mu} \psi)^{*} (D_{\mu} \psi)$ term.

%========================================================================================

\subsection{Electroweak Interactions}
\label{sec:ewint}
The electroweak sector of the Standard Model is that related to the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ symmetry \cite{Ellis:2013jnq}.  In this sector, spontaneous symmetry breaking must occur in such a way as to give three massive gauge bosons,  $\text{W}^{\pm}$ and Z, and one massless gauge boson, the $\gamma$.  This can be achieved through a Higgs field, H, that transforms as a doublet under the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ symmetry.  The Lagrangian for this field is
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{Higgs} = (D_{\mu}\text{H})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\text{H} - \text{V}(\text{H}) \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent The Higgs potential, V(H), is
%
\begin{equation}
\text{V}(\text{H}) = -\mu^{2}\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H} + \lambda (\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H})^{2} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are constants.  The covariant derivative of this Higgs field must satisfy the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ gauge symmetry meaning it takes the form
%
\begin{equation}
D_{\mu} \text{H} = (\partial_{\mu} + ig_{1}YB_{\mu} + ig_{2}\frac{\tau^{i}}{2}W^{i}_{\mu})\text{H} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are coupling constants for the U(1) and $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ gauged symmetries\textcolor{blue}{,} respectively, $Y = \frac{1}{2}$ is the weak hypercharge of the Higgs and $\tau^{i}$ are the Pauli matrices.  $B_{\mu}$ and $W^{i}_{\mu}$ are the gauge fields for the U(1) and $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ gauged symmetries respectively.  

Consider spontaneously breaking the symmetry in the Higgs sector by expanding the Higgs field about a non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev)
%
\begin{equation}
\langle \text{H} \rangle = \binom{0}{\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}} \text{ ,}
\label{equ:higgsmin}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where the minima of the field is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu^{2}}{2\lambda}} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $v$ real.  In that case, the kinematic term in the Higgs Lagrangian, $D^{\mu} \text{H}^{\dagger} D_{\mu} \text{H}$, contains mass terms for the gauge bosons
%
\begin{equation}
D^{\mu} \text{H}^{\dagger} D_{\mu} \text{H} \subset \frac{v^{2}}{2}(ig_{1}YB^{\mu} + ig_{2}\frac{\tau^{i}}{2}W^{i\mu})(ig_{1}YB_{\mu} + ig_{2}\frac{\tau^{i}}{2}W^{i}_{\mu}) \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent If there is mixing of the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ and U(1) fields of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\text{Z}_{\mu} = \text{cos}{\theta_{W}} \text{W}^{3}_{\mu} - \text{sin}{\theta_{W}} \text{B}_{\mu} \text{ ,}\\
\text{A}_{\mu} = \text{sin}{\theta_{W}} \text{W}^{3}_{\mu} + \text{cos}{\theta_{W}} \text{B}_{\mu} \text{ ,}\\
\text{W}^{\pm}_{\mu} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\text{W}^{1}_{\mu} \mp i \text{W}^{2}_{\mu}) \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent then the following gauge boson mass terms are generated
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{(gv)^{2}}{4} \text{W}^{+}_{\mu} \text{W}^{-\mu} + \frac{(g^{2} + g'^{2})v^{2}}{8} \text{Z}_{\mu} \text{Z}^{\mu} \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent The gauge boson masses generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field are
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
m_{\text{W}} = & \frac{gv}{2} \text{ ,} \\
m_{\text{Z}} = & \frac{v\sqrt{g^{2} + g'^{2}}}{2} = \frac{m_{W}}{\text{cos}{\theta_{W}}} \text{ ,} \\
m_{\text{A}} = & 0 \text{ ,}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\theta_{W}$ is the Weinberg angle.  This mixing produces a massless gauge boson, the $\gamma$, and three massive gauge bosons, the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$.  By acquiring a non-zero vev, the Higgs field breaks the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ symmetry that was present in the Lagrangian to the $\text{U}(1)_{em}$ symmetry of electromagnetism.  

The ratio of the masses of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons is predicted when spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the Higgs sector.  This prediction sets the $\rho$ parameter to unity, where the $\rho$ parameter is defined as
%
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{m_{\text{W}}^{2}}{m_{\text{Z}}^{2}\text{cos}{\theta_{W}}^{2}} = 1\text{ .}
\label{equ:custodialsymmetry}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent This is a consequence of the Higgs potential containing custodial symmetry \cite{Beringer:1900zz}.  As the $\rho$ parameter has been experimentally measured to be $1.00040 \pm 0.00024$ \cite{Agashe:2014kda}, it is clear that any extension to the Standard Model should retain this result.

%========================================================================================

\subsubsection{Custodial Symmetry}
The Standard Model Higgs field is defined by the Lagrangian
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{Higgs} = (D_{\mu}\text{H})^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\text{H} - \text{V}(\text{H}) \text{,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where
%
\begin{equation}
\text{V}(\text{H}) = -\mu^{2}\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H} + \lambda (\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H})^{2} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent and $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are constants.  By construction the Higgs sector of the Standard Model is invariant under local $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ gauge transformations.  However, a larger global symmetry also exists in this sector, which can be seen by examining the Higgs doublet \cite{Ellis:1991qj}
%
\begin{equation}
\text{H} = \binom{\psi^{+}}{\psi^{0}} = \binom{\psi_{1} + i\psi_{2}}{\psi_{3} + i\psi_{4}} \text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent All the terms in the Higgs potential involve $\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H} = \psi_{1}^{2} + \psi_{2}^{2} + \psi_{3}^{2} + \psi_{4}^{2}$, which is invariant under any rotation of these four components and hence under \textcolor{blue}{an} SO(4) global symmetry.  In general, $\text{SO}(4) \cong \text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$, where $\cong$ denotes an isomorphism.  In the case of the Higgs sector $\text{SO}(4) \cong \text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ where the $\text{SU}(2)_{L}$ symmetry is the gauged symmetry of the Standard Model.  This symmetry can be manifested using an alternative parameterisation \cite{Andersen:2011yj} of the Higgs field
%
\begin{equation}
\Phi = (i\tau_{2}\text{H}, \text{H}) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\psi^{0*} & \psi^{+} \\
-\psi^{+*} & \psi^{0}
\end{pmatrix} 
\text{ .}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent In this parametrisation the Higgs Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{Higgs}$, becomes
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{Higgs} =  \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}[(D_{\mu}\Phi)^{\dagger}D^{\mu}\Phi] + \mu^{2}\text{Tr}[\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi] - \lambda \text{Tr}[\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi] \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent which is invariant under transformations of the form
%
\begin{equation}
\Phi \rightarrow U_{L} \Phi U_{R}^{\dagger} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $U_{L}$ and $U_{R}$ are transformations of the $\text{SU}(2)_{L}$ and $\text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry groups respectively.

When the Higgs field acquires a non-zero vev the $\text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry of the Higgs potential is broken to \textcolor{blue}{an} $\text{SU}(2)_{C}$ symmetry, which is known as custodial symmetry \cite{Grojean:2007zz}.  As $\text{SO}(3) \cong \text{SU}(2)$, symmetry breaking in the Higgs sector is equivalent to \textcolor{blue}{an} SO(4) symmetry being broken to \textcolor{blue}{an} SO(3) symmetry.  This becomes clear when inspecting the form of the Higgs potential after symmetry breaking.  After expanding the Higgs field about the non-zero vev that is defined in equation \ref{equ:higgsmin}, the terms in the Higgs potential involve $\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H} = (\psi_{3}-v)^{2} + \psi_{1}^{2} + \psi_{2}^{2} + \psi_{4}^{2}$.  Since $\text{H}^{\dagger}\text{H} $ is only invariant to rotations between the $\psi_{1}$, $\psi_{2}$ and $\psi_{4}$ fields, the SO(4) global symmetry of the Higgs potential has been broken by spontaneous symmetry breaking to \textcolor{blue}{an} SO(3) symmetry.

The Higgs field, H, transforms a singlet under this $\text{SU}(2)_{C}$ custodial symmetry, while the $\text{SU}(2)_{L}$ gauge boson fields, $W^{i}_{\mu}$, transform as a triplet.  It is the transformation of the $W^{i}_{\mu}$ fields under the $\text{SU}(2)_{C}$ symmetry that enforces the relationship between the masses of the $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ gauge bosons and that $\rho$ should equal unity.  It should be noted that the $\text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry only exists in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model.  The $\text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry in the Standard Model is broken by Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to quarks and leptons and by a non-zero coupling to the U(1) gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, $g_{1}$.  However, this breaking of the $\text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry is weak, which means the deviations of $\rho$ from unity are minimal \cite{Grojean:2007zz}.

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Anomalous Gauge Couplings}}

\textcolor{blue}{The existence of a light Higgs boson, as discovered by the LHC \cite{Chatrchyan:2012xdj, Aad:2012tfa}, suggests the presence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.  The naturalness principle suggests that the mass of the Higgs boson, $\sim 125$~GeV, should be similar to the Plank energy, $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{19})$~GeV, however, is not the case.  Such a disparity can only be resolved with a large amount of fine-tuning, which is undesirable, or beyond Standard Model physics involving new particles that protect the Higgs mass from large radiative corrections.  Searching the electroweak sector of the Standard Model for deviations from Standard Model predictions is a natural starting point when searching for new physics that could resolve the naturalness problem of the Higgs.  One such search is presented in chapter \ref{chap:PhysicsAnalysis} and uses an effective field theory (EFT) framework to parameterise deviations from the Standard Model through anomalous gauge couplings.  The EFT framework is discussed in section \ref{sec:eft} and the electroweak chiral Lagrangian from which the anomalous gauge couplings arise is discussed in section \ref{sec:ewchiral}.}

\subsection{Effective Field Theory}
\label{sec:eft}
There are a number of features in the observable universe that cannot be accounted for using the Standard Model of particle physics.  However, the Standard Model provides a very good description of the interactions between particles at the energies being probed at modern particle collider experiments.  Any underlying theory governing the interactions of particles must, therefore, behave like the Standard Model over these energies, or distance scales.  Above such energies the theory will deviate from the Standard Model in order to account for the full underlying theory.  Effective field theories (EFTs) work from this premise by assuming that the complete theory has a momentum scale, $\Lambda$, below which Standard Model behaviour is replicated \cite{Degrande:2013rea, Arzt:1993gz}.  

Quantum field theories must be renormalizable to ensure that non-infinite predictions of the coefficients in the Lagrangian can be made and tested \cite{Gripaios:2015qya}.  Infinities arise from non-renormalizable theories due to divergent integrals from loop diagrams that assume the theory being applied is valid at all energy and length scales.  Effective field theories act to avoid such problems by only integrating up to the momentum scale $\Lambda$ and not above it.  At the energy scale being considered, any infinities arising from the loop calculations in the EFT can be absorbed into a finite number of parameters.  This methodology avoids the assumption that the theory in question is applicable to all energy scales and allows measurable predictions to be made.  

As the Standard Model should be replicated at the low energy scale, it is appropriate when creating an EFT Lagrangian to append new operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian to account for areas of new physics.  This gives the general form for an EFT Lagrangian as \cite{Degrande:2013rea}
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{EFT} = \mathcal{L}_{SM} + \sum_{\text{dimension d>4}} \sum_{i} \frac{c_{i}^{(d)}}{\Lambda^{d-4}} \mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)} \text{ ,}
\label{equ:eft}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\mathcal{L}_{SM}$ is the Standard Model Lagrangian, $c_{i}^{(d)}$ are free parameters, $\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}$ is the $i^{th}$ unique operator with dimension $d$ in the EFT and $\Lambda$ is the EFT momentum scale.  The sum runs over all unique operators with dimension greater than four.  The presence of the $\Lambda^{d-4}$ in the denominator is required to ensure correct dimensionality of the new terms being added to the Lagrangian.  

New physics is introduced by the operators $\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}$, but suppressed by the momentum scale $\Lambda$.  It is assumed that $\Lambda$ is large with respect to the momentum scales that have been examined at pre\textcolor{blue}{-}existing particle collider experiments, therefore, any new physics is suppressed.  Under this assumption, new operators with dimension less than, or equal to, four can be vetoed from the EFT as their effects would be readily observed at preexisting particle collider experiments, due to the $\Lambda^{4-d}$ coefficient.  At energies below the momentum scale, $\Lambda$, it is possible to find the dominant new physics terms in the EFT and consider these as corrections to the Standard Model.  Above this scale the EFT breaks down as operator $\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}$ in $\mathcal{L}_{EFT}$ has a non-negligible coefficient.  In the extremal limit, $\Lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the Standard Model is recovered as new physics is too far out of reach to have any impact on observables.

\subsection{Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian}
\label{sec:ewchiral}
The introduction of a Higgs field undergoing spontaneous symmetry breaking is able to produce mass terms in the Lagrangian for the $\text{W}^{\pm}$ and Z bosons.  However, it is possible to introduce these terms by parameterising the Higgs field using the gauge boson fields of the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ Standard Model symmetry \cite{Herrero:1994tj}.  In this approach, the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking mirrors that found in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model i.e. a global $\text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry is broken to \textcolor{blue}{an} $\text{SU}(2)_{C}$ symmetry.  This will ensure that the $\rho$ parameter, introduced in section \ref{sec:ewint}, retains a value of unity which is consistent with experimental measurements.  The Standard Model spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern can be replicated using a field, $\Sigma(x)$, which transforms under the $\text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ global symmetries as
%
\begin{equation}
\Sigma \rightarrow U_{L} \Sigma U_{R}^{\dagger} \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $U_{L}$ and $U_{R}$ are transformations of the $\text{SU}(2)_{L}$ and $\text{SU}(2)_{R}$ symmetry groups\textcolor{blue}{,} respectively\textcolor{blue}{,} and $\Sigma(x)$ is
%
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(x) = \text{exp} \bigg(\frac{-i}{v} \Sigma^{3}_{a=1} \pi^{a}\tau^{a}\bigg)\text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\pi^{a}$ are the three would-be Goldstone bosons that exist when the $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to $\text{U}(1)_{em}$ \cite{Longhitano:1980tm}.  The $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}}$ and $\text{U}(1)$ symmetries of the Standard Model are gauged in the usual way by defining the covariant derivate of the $\Sigma$ field
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_{\mu} \Sigma(x) = \partial_{\mu} \Sigma(x) + \frac{ig_{2}}{2}\text{W}_{\mu}^{a}\tau^{a}\Sigma(x) - \frac{ig_{1}}{2}\text{B}_{\mu}\tau^{3}\Sigma(x) \text{ ,}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are coupling constants for the U(1) and SU$(2)_\text{L}$ symmetries respectively and $\tau^{a}$ are the Pauli spin matrices.  The lowest order derivative term for this $\Sigma$ field that could appear in the Lagrangian is
%
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\Sigma} = \frac{v^{2}}{4} \text{Tr} (\mathcal{D}^{\mu} \Sigma^{\dagger} \mathcal{D}_{\mu} \Sigma) = -\frac{v^{2}}{4}\text{Tr}(V_{\mu} V^{\mu}) \text{ ,} 
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $V_{\mu} = (\mathcal{D}_{\mu}\Sigma) \Sigma^{\dagger}$.  This terms respects all the symmetries present in the Higgs sector of that Standard Model, including the custodial symmetry in the limit $g_{1} \rightarrow 0$.  Furthermore, by expanding this field about a non-zero vev, the $\text{SU}(2)_{L} \times \text{SU}(2)_{R}$ global symmetry is broken to \textcolor{blue}{an} $\text{SU}(2)_{C}$ symmetry exactly as it is in the Standard Model.  For example, if this field is expanded about the point $\Sigma = \textbf{1}$, i.e. the unitary gauge, mass terms for the electroweak gauge bosons are generated that match those produced from spontaneous symmetry breaking of the Higgs field as described in section \ref{sec:ssb}
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{v^{2}}{4}\text{Tr}[V^{\mu}V_{\mu}] = - \frac{(gv)^{2}}{4} \text{W}^{+}_{\mu} \text{W}^{-\mu} - \frac{(g^{2} + g'^{2})v^{2}}{8} \text{Z}_{\mu} \text{Z}^{\mu} \\
\begin{aligned}
m_{\text{A}} = & 0 \text{ ,} \\
m_{\text{W}} = & \frac{gv}{2} \text{ ,} \\
m_{\text{Z}} = & \frac{v\sqrt{g^{2} + g'^{2}}}{2} = \frac{m_{\text{W}}}{\text{cos}{\theta_{W}}} \text{ \textcolor{blue}{.}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

So far, all that has been done is a parameterisation of the Higgs field, however, it was shown by Longhitano \cite{Longhitano:1980tm} that there are several relevant operators involving the $\Sigma$ field that are $\text{SU}(2)_{\text{L}} \times \text{U}(1)$ invariant.  As these operators obey the same symmetries as those found in the Standard Model they should be considered.  This can be done using EFT approach, as discussed in section \ref{sec:eft}.  Of the operators introduced by Longhitano, only two involve quartic massive gauge boson vertices and preserve the custodial symmetry \cite{Belyaev:1998ih}.  These are
%
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{4}\text{Tr}[V^{\mu}V_{\nu}]\text{Tr}[V^{\nu}V_{\mu}] \quad \text{ and } \quad \alpha_{5}\text{Tr}[V^{\mu}V_{\mu}]^{2} \text{ .}
\label{equ:newterms}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent These terms contribute to the massive gauge boson quartic vertices shown in figure \ref{fig:agcvertices}.  The Standard Model already contains triple and quartic vertices involving the electroweak gauge bosons, shown in figure \ref{fig:smtripleandquarticverticestheory}, and these are also present in this EFT approach.  These vertices originate from the kinematic terms in the Proca Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{kin} = -\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}W_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}$.  Of the vertices showing sensitivity to $\alpha_{4}$ and $\alpha_{5}$, only the vertex shown in figure \ref{fig:agcvertex3} is not present in the Standard Model.  

Both terms shown in equation \ref{equ:newterms} contain dimension 8 operators \cite{Degrande:2013rea} and, with respect to the EFT approach (i.e. equation \ref{equ:eft}) their coefficients are proportional to $\Lambda^{-4}$, where $\Lambda$ is the momentum scale of the new physics being modelled.  In the limit that the momentum scale of new physics is beyond experimental reach, i.e. $\Lambda \rightarrow \infty$, these terms do not contribute to measurable observables and the Standard Model is recovered.  It should be noted that in this case, the Standard Model has been parameterised using the $\Sigma$ field; so, in the limit $\Lambda \rightarrow \infty$, the gauge boson mass terms generated from $\mathcal{L}_{\Sigma}$ do not vanish.
